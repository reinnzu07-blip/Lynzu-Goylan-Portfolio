    <h1>About Me</h1>
 <img src="../Assets/images/aboutme.png" width="500px" height="500px">

 <p>It's my pleasure to introduce myself to all of you, I am Lynzu Dela Cruz Goylan and my nickname is "ruzz-ruzz" but they always called me timoy or timmy, 
    I am 20 yrs old from Purok-6 Riverside Laih, Siay, Zamboanga Sibugay, I am the son of Bambie Baguioro Goylan 
    and Marilyn Dulom Dela Cruz they are separated from each other over when we are little kids then. 
    My mother give birth on me at Cebu city but i don't really know the complete address of that hospital.
    My birthday is on <a href="act3.html">March 05, 2005</a> and I have four siblings and I am the fourth child and all of us
    are male. As I remember they usually say that all of us siblings I am so called a silent one they are scared of me before
    because i don't really talk they thought that I was mute but I only start talking when I was 5 yrs old sounds crazy but they really said it
    to me I don't really mind if it's true or not. I remember when I was grade 1 my mother always go with me in the school and the crazy part is that
    i don't want to enter the room because I am scared and I don't want to let go my mother and I start crying non-stop when she left me until now
    my mother always teasing me about it and I don't care, my elementary journey that my parents was proud of me 
    when I got honor of academic excellence award when I graduated.  </br>

    Now move on let's talk about my high school life, I was one of so-called Franahis student on Francisco, Ramos, National, High School(FRNHS) 
    I was very Independent that go alone only myself to enroll on that school that I was really nervous and worried that time, my chosen track TVL is 
    EIM "Electrical Installation and Maintenance". I am so grateful that our school have complete equitment and tools of my chosen track. 
    When the first day has came,I remember that I was running because I was late, I was amaze that there are so many student walking and finding there 
    room, it took me an hour to find my name on every door of the room and also I go to canteen to get snack and I was really exhausted 
    that time do you believe me. When I finally find the room,I am a transferee student for you to know and as when I was going to sit 
    the teacher called me to introduce myself and It was so embarras that time because I couldn't talk fluent on delivering my words.
    I remember my first failure of installing appliance which is electric fan do you know that the switch of it was exploded and burned, I was 
    scared and nervous that time of my major teacher what will he going to say about what happen, I was glad that I find a way to fix it. 
    My major teacher was finding student who's going to install solar light for our gym inside the school, I quickly volunteer myself and my only reason
    is that I will be excuse for every class we will have. and I was assign by my teacher to draw the layout plan/floor plan because he knew that I am good at it,
    it took 2 months to finally install all solar light and my teacher give us big points for our hard work. When the fourth quarther come, my major teacher
    told as that we are going to go out of school guess what? we are going to specific place assigned by our major teacher for 10 days immersion, I was
    so excited that I am one of the first batch. When the immersion came, I have so many things with me that I carry and I was so tired of carrying it
    and our ride arrived we hop on to it and go. Our 10 day immersion was great we were able to experience real life doing installing appliance and so
    many more. I was greatful that we are successfully done our 10 days and go home. I graduated senior high with first honor and award about our immersion
    on May 30, 2024. </br>

    <p>Now we will going to talk about my journey on college, I didn't proceed college because I waited my brother to graduate so that my parents 
    won't have problem to school us at the same time. My tambay day is not really boring because I was able to find a job a catering service kind which 
    is so exhausted but I really enjoy doing it and experience cooking kind of dish and serving it to the people. When the time has come for me 
    to proceed college I did it and took comsci(Bachelor of Science in Computer Science) and I was glad that I survive the first semester. and now
    we going to the final semester and we hope that we will survive it.  </p>
